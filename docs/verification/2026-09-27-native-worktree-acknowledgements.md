# Functional native worktree acknowledgement budget (#435)

Functional Codex working-copy checks now use the adapter's normal 15-second acknowledgement budget. The intentional lost-creation case explicitly keeps its two-second budget, scripted three-second reply delay, reserved working-copy checks and refusal to create the same native thread twice. The accepted-results, native proof-file, project-scope, working-directory and restoration assertions are unchanged. No production adapter or deadline changed.

## Controlled evidence

The #386 full suite at `2265e87d` reported one concurrent Codex worktree failure: its first send was uncertain and its second was accepted. The full run recorded 5,864 passed, 140 skipped and one failure. It did not capture the underlying acknowledgement error. An unchanged isolated target and three instrumented repetitions passed, so that run's precise cause remains unproven.

A bounded diagnostic copied the existing concurrent functional scenario, retaining its exact assertions. The existing fake-provider script delayed the first-arriving `turn/start` acknowledgement by 2,300 ms. The trace recorded only method names, receipt outcomes, synthetic message IDs and booleans comparing the native proof files to their expected synthetic prompts.

- Current main `c7ec297f` with the original fixture: the accepted-results assertion failed. The delayed request rejected after 2,001.1 ms with the acknowledgement-timeout error, while both native proof files matched. [Baseline receipt](../../artifacts/review-435/baseline-receipt.json).
- The corrected fixture with the same delay: both sends were accepted, the delayed reply was acknowledged after 2,336.1 ms, both native proofs matched, and all original scope/restoration assertions passed. [Corrected receipt](../../artifacts/review-435/corrected-receipt.json). One target passed, 15 were filtered out, in 8.44 seconds.
- Unmodified native worktree and local worktree suites: 39 passed across two files in 79.20 seconds, including the deliberately lost creation acknowledgement and its unchanged no-replay checks.

These measurements identify premature fixture timeout under the controlled delay; they do not establish that the original full-run failure had the same cause. No test asserts a stopwatch budget. Diagnostic copies were renamed outside Vitest discovery. All data and providers were synthetic.

Typecheck passed. The following lint process exited abnormally (-1073740791) after its startup header, without a rule diagnostic; that attempt is not a lint pass. After the resource hold, a single sequential static slot using npm.cmd passed lint and notices. The original process failure remains recorded separately. Independent native Astra Standards and Spec reviews and the coordinating source/receipt review reported zero findings at `24543b9a`. The full two-worker suite remains queued. This is test-only; no Electron surface or design baseline changed.
